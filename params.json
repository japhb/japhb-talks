You're free to use material from them for your own talks\r\nunder the usual cc-by rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n# PREREQS\r\n\r\nFor building the presentations, you'll need a Perl 6 compiler to run\r\n`make-presentations`, and PhantomJS to run `render.js` if you want to\r\ngrab web page renderings as PNGs automatically (for e.g. updating the\r\nbenchark graphs for the `need-for-speed` deck).  You'll also need dpic\r\nto convert PIC diagrams to SVG format for web browser display; you can\r\nfind dpic at: https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~aplevich/dpic/ .\r\n\r\nFor presenting the results, Reveal.js is included using a Git submodule.\r\n\r\n\r\n# LICENSE\r\n\r\nThese talks and associated tools are licensed under a Creative Commons\r\nAttribution 4.0 International License, except where stated otherwise.\r\nPlease see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ for details.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
