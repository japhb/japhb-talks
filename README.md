# OVERVIEW

These are talks (given or WIP) by Geoffrey Broadwell, japhb on GitHub
and Freenode.  You're free to use material from them for your own talks
under the usual cc-by-sa rules.


# PREREQS

For building the presentations, you'll need a Perl 6 compiler to run
`make-presentations`, and PhantomJS to run `render.js` if you want to
grab web page renderings as PNGs automatically (for e.g. updating the
benchark graphs for the `need-for-speed` deck).

For presenting the results, Reveal.js is included using a Git submodule.
